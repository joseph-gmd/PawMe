<h2 align="center"> PAW ME: A Dog Adoption Application. </h2> 
<p align = "justify"> The "PAW ME: A Dog Adoption Application" project is specifically created for dog adoption automation. The app will display a list of available dogs for adoption in the Batangas area. The program will provide dog lovers with a simple, direct, and convenient way to search for dogs to adopt. Through filters depending on the location, breed, age, size, and gender of a dog, they can locate the ideal companion for them. They would no longer need to visit dog shelters and rescue organizations because of this application, but would instead download and install the app. </p>
