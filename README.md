<h2 align="center"> PAW ME: A Dog Adoption Application. </h2>

### Introduction
<p align = "justify"> The "PAW ME: A Dog Adoption Application" project is specifically created for dog adoption automation. The app will display a list of available dogs for adoption in the Batangas area. The program will provide dog lovers with a simple, direct, and convenient way to search for dogs to adopt. Through filters depending on the location, breed, age, size, and gender of a dog, they can locate the ideal companion for them. They would no longer need to visit dog shelters and rescue organizations because of this application, but would instead download and install the app. </p>

### Purpose and Description
<p align = "justify">Homelessness affects millions of people in the Philippines. While adults occasionally have odd jobs to live,  on children beg for spare change on the streets. These Filipinos work as hard as they can to support themselves and their families, with some of them sleeping beneath bridges at night. 

However, many people overlook the number of stray animals who suffer the same fate as their human counterparts when talking about the nation's fight against homelessness. While these phrases may appear harmless, they have accumulated implications that regrettably can make stray animals seem commonplace and undesirable in comparison to purebred, pedigreed companions, and aspins slang for asong Pinoy terms that translate as "Filipino dog" in the Philippines. 

These stray canines wander the streets and frequently try to find any food scraps in canals and trash cans. If they're lucky, they are saved and taken in by compassionate people who are prepared to welcome them into their households and provide them with the shelter and comfort they require.

As a result, the team will focus to design and create a mobile application that will allow users to adopt dogs in the Batangas area. Ionic Framework and other tools are used in the project's development. </p>
### SDG
